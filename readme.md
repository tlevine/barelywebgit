BarelyWebGit
===========

BarelyWebGit statically generates a barely-web-site that inside of a
[NearlyFreeSpeech.net](http://nearlyfreespeech.net) site. Well you
could host the site somewhere else, but the default configuration uses
NearlyFreeSpeech.net's directory structure, and you'd probably be able
to use something fancier if you were hosting somewhere.


## Alternatives
If you want a static git site generator and BarelyWebGit is too bare,
you might try [git2html](http://hssl.cs.jhu.edu/~neal/git2html/).

If you want something fancy and dynamic, check out the
[list of web interfaces](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Interfaces,_frontends,_and_tools#Web_Interfaces)
on the kernel.org wiki. Most of them are pretty easy to install,
just not on NearlyFreeSpeech.
